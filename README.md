# [Network Deactivated but Active Elsewhere](https://github.com/brasofilo/Network-Deactivated-but-Active-Elsewhere)
<sup>*Version 1.0*</sup>

*Shows an indicator in the Network Plugins page  
whether a plugin is being used by any blog of the network.  
Shows the list of blogs on rollover.*

**Better used as a mu-plugin.**

There are cases where a Network activated plugin  
also shows the <kbd>Active Elsewhere</kbd> button.  
And -I suppose- this is because the plugin  
was active prior to Network activation.


<sub>***IN ACTION***</sub>
